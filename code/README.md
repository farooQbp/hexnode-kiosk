# Hexnode Application

This is a React.js application that you can clone and set up locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

Start by cloning the project from the Git repository. You can do this using the following command:

git clone -b master https://github.com/farooQbp/hexnode.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd hexnode
```

### 3. Install dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### 4. Start the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using:

```bash
npm start
```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (by default). You can open this in your browser to see the application in action.

### 5. Build the application (optional)

If you need to create a production-ready build of the application, you can do so by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build/` directory with the optimized files for deployment.
